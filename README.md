Supplementary material regarding the analysis of heating options for Quebec
using a TIMES model [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/93194964.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/93194964)

The repository includes several jupyter notebooks used in the [article](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261917310036?via%3Dihub):

Astudillo, M.F., Vaillancourt, K., Pineau, P.-O., Amor, B., 2017. Can the household sector reduce global warming mitigation costs? sensitivity to key parameters in a TIMES techno-economic energy model. Appl. Energy 205, 486â€“498. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.07.130

The repository contains:

**Household heating availability factors**: calculation of annual availability
factors from hourly temperature data. Comparison with alternative method
proposed by Papakostas et al. 2009

**run-of-river** calculation of a proxy for run-of-river production in Quebec
from runoff data of several hydrometric stations.

**solar** calculation of solar availability factors per time-slice for pv pannels.
Derived from the temporal distribution of solar irradiation data in Montreal and
 an annual AF.

**wind** calculation of the availability factors per time-slice from the data
made available by the Pan-Canadian study of wind power potential.

**Estimating AF of hydropower - reservoir and runoff** Estimation of AF of
hydropower plants in Quebec.

**Comparing heating demand of different cities** Comparison of monthly heating
demand for the most populated cities in Quebec.
 
it also contains most of the underlying data required to run the notebooks.
