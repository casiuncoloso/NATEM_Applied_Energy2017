supplementary material regarding the analysis of heating options for Quebec using a TIMES model

the repository includes several jupyter notebooks used in the article:

Can the household sector reduce global warming mitigation costs? Sensitivity to key parameters 
in a TIMES techno-economic energy model (submitted to Applied Energy)

The repository contains:

**Household heating availability factors**: calculation of annual availability factors from hourly 
temperature data. Comparison with alternative method proposed by Papakostas et al. 2009

**run-of-river** calculation of a proxy for run-of-river production in Quebec from runoff
data of several hydrometric stations. 

**solar** calculation of solar availability factors per time-slice for pv pannels. Derived from
the temporal distribution of solar irradiation data in Montreal and an annual AF.

**wind** calculation of the availability factors per time-slice from the data made available by
the Pan-Canadian study of wind power potential
