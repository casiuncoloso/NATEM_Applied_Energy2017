1 Introduction

1.1 What are the CWEEDS files?

The CWEEDS files are computer data sets of hourly weather conditions occurring
at 145 Canadian locations for up to 48 years of record, starting as early as
1953, and ending for most locations in 2001. The primary purpose of these files
is to provide long term weather records for use in urban planning, siting and
design of wind and solar renewable energy systems, and design of energy
efficient buildings. The general nature of the files, however, results in their
widespread applicability to any sector which is weather-sensitive, such as
transportation, air quality, agriculture, forestry, tourism, structural design,
or general interest.

Users will likely find most value in providing the files as input into other
software that processes the observational data in some way that provides more
specific information germane to the user's requirements. For example, the
information in the CWEEDS files can be used as input to design software that
simulates building or solar energy system performance on an hourly basis. Other
possibilities include the calculation of summary statistics regarding the wind
energy potential at a location, or finding the means, variability, extremes, or
frequency of other weather conditions or combination of conditions specifically
tailored to suit an application.

There is virtually no limit to the variety of useful analyses that can be
performed with the data in the CWEEDS files. The user will, however, need to
provide the software which will perform any additional analyses. Importing the
data into a spreadsheet or data base program is a common way in which further
analysis may be performed.

The CWEEDS CD-ROMs and disk only include compressed, formatted files of
observed and estimated weather observations, utility software to uncompress and
copy the files from the CD-ROMs, and documentation to explain the development,
content, and format of the files.

Most of the 21 weather elements such as temperature and wind speed have been
abstracted directly from the National Digital Climate Archives maintained by
the Atmospheric Environment Service (AES) of Environment Canada in Downsview,
Ontario. Nine of the weather elements relate to solar irradiance amounts and
have been estimated for each hour for those elements and locations for which
observations are not available.

The computer data sets are arranged so that one year of weather data for one
location is contained in one file about one megabyte in size in the
uncompressed, WYEC2 format described below. There are 48 files, for instance,
totalling over 48 megabytes disk space in WYEC2 format for the full 1953-2001
CWEEDS period of record. In total, the full CWEEDS 4500 files comprise a little
over 4.5 gigabytes. 

A second set of files, called CWEC (Canadian Weather year for Energy
Calculation), has been provided for convenience for a limited number of the
locations. These files are described in Section 4.

1.3 The background of the CWEEDS files

Climatic information related to solar irradiance for building and solar energy
systems was provided by the 1985 Environment Canada publication Solar Radiation
Data Analyses for Canada 1967-1976 (Volumes 1-6, Environment Canada, 1985). The
increasing power, storage capacity, and cost-effectiveness of personal
computers, accompanied by the sophistication of software used for building and
energy system design has led to the requirement for ready access to long term
hourly weather data sets. Environment Canada consulted with the user community
in making decisions about the format and media used and obtained funding
support from the Government of Canada Federal Panel on Energy Research and
Development (PERD) to produce the CWEEDS files.

1.4 The format used for the CWEEDS files

The WYEC2 data format and units, described in Appendix A, was adopted for the
CWEEDS files. WYEC2 (Weather Year for Energy Calculation, Version 2) has been
devised by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning
Engineers (ASHRAE) for providing WYEC2 data files for 76 cities including 5 in
Canada (scheduled for release in June 1993). ASHRAE adapted the WYEC2 format
from the TMY (Typical Meteorological Year) file format developed by Sandia
National Laboratories in the US in the late 1970's.

The WYEC2 format is significantly different from the file format and
organization of hourly data used by the AES internally in the National Digital
Climate Archives. Users who have obtained hourly weather observations from AES
previously should note the differences outlined below. For emphasis, the
different aspects of the AES format are presented in italics.

          One record of the WYEC2 file format contains all the weather elements
          for one hour. Thus there is one record, comprising of the station
          identification, date-time stamp, and 21 observational elements and
          data flags, for each hour. (Note that this is different from the AES
          file format, in which each record contains all 24 hours of a given
          observational element for each day.)

          Hour "1" of the WYEC2 format is 1:00 AM and hour "24" is midnight,
          local standard time, including solar irradiance and minutes of
          sunshine. (In the AES format, the hours for a day range from midnight
          to 23:00 [11 PM]. The hours for all the AES elements are local
          standard time except for hourly solar irradiance amounts and minutes
          of sunshine which are referenced to local apparent [solar] time.)


2 Characteristics of the Weather Elements

The units, field number, data and flag positions, and the meanings of
alphanumeric data and flags are presented in Appendix A. Additional
clarification for some fields,such as how they were observed, estimated or
modelled, or abstracted from the AES Climate Archives, appears below. In some
cases, comments as to the representativeness of the observed values are
provided as guidance to the user.

WBAN (field 001) number is an 5-character station identification number used in
the WYEC2 format. It originated in the US and WBAN numbers were assigned to
Canadian locations until recently. For locations for which no WBAN number has
been officially assigned, an artificial identifier has been provided. These
"unofficial WBAN" numbers all start with the characters "CAN". For those files
in which the location for solar irradiance measurements is different from the
location where the other hourly elements are observed (see discussion on solar
irradiance, below), the WBAN number corresponds to the station at which solar
irradiance is observed.

Solar global horizontal irradiance (field 102) observations are available for
some of the period of record for 35 of the 143 CWEEDS locations. At 21 of the
locations the solar irradiance observation site is coincident with the hourly
weather observing site for part of the period of record. At the other 14
locations, the solar irradiance amounts were observed at a different AES
observing site generally within 40 km of the hourly weather observing site.
Appendix B provides the AES station number for the hourly weather observing
site (WX.CSN) and the station number for the solar irradiance observing site
(RAD.CSN).

The solar irradiance observations in the AES Climate Archives are referenced to
local apparent (solar) time. The values were adjusted to local standard time
for inclusion in the CWEEDS files by means of an algorithm developed by Perez
(Morris et al., 1992;  Perez et al., 1990).

The MAC3 model was used to estimate solar global horizontal irradiance for the
108 locations and times for which observations were unavailable (Davies et al.,
1984; Environment Canada, 1985). Solar irradiance was estimated for some hours
by the WON statistical model or linear interpolation when the MAC3 model
failed, particularily when it could not be used due to missing cloud
observations. The data flag with each field indicates whether the solar
irradiance amount is observed or modelled. It is important to note that the
modelling errors can be substantial for any given hour. The root-mean-square
error for hourly solar global horizontal irradiance amounts are typically
around 30% (Morris and Skinner, 1990). The long term average error however is
5% or lower. Thus it is unadvisable to use the modelled irradiance amounts if
it is important to know the amount for a particular hour of a particular day.

A further note of caution: if the location of the solar irradiance observing
site is different from the hourly weather observing site, then any given hourly
irradiance amount may not be consistent with the cloud amount or opacity
observations.

Direct normal irradiance (field 103) was estimated from the solar global
horizontal irradiance using the MAC3 model for locations and hours for which
observations of global solar horizontal irradiance were unavailable. An
algorithm developed by Perez (Perez et al., 1990 and 1991, Morris et al., 1992)
was used if the hourly observed global solar horizontal irradiance was
available.

Diffuse horizontal irradiance (field 104) is observed at 5 locations. For other
locations this element was estimated by the MAC3 model when the observations of
the global solar horizontal irradiance was unavailable. An algorithm developed
by Perez (Perez et al., 1991, Morris et al., 1992) was used if the hourly
observed global solar horizontal irradiance was available.

Global horizontal illuminance (field 105), direct normal illuminance (field
106), and diffuse horizontal illuminance (field 107) were all modelled using an
algorithm developed by McCluney (McCluney, 1984; McArthur, 1990; Morris and
Skinner, 1990).

No estimates are available of the zenith illuminance (field 108). This field is
always missing.

Minutes of sunshine (field 110), where observations are available are
abstracted from the AES Climate Archives with adjustments made to convert the
time base from local apparent (solar) time to local standard time. No values
are estimated if observations are unavailable.

The units of Wind speed (field 209) observations are 0.1 m/s. Wind speed is
provided in km/h in the AES Climate Archives. The observation is an estimate of
the one-minute mean wind speed on each hour for the years before 1985 and a
two-minute mean wind speed thereafter. Care is required in assuming wind speed
and direction representativeness at nearby locations. Wind speed is sensitive
to the height above ground and exposure of the anemometer.

Most of the anemometers at the locations in the CWEEDS files are mounted at 10m
above ground in a flat, open exposure such as at airport locations. AES
anemometers have not always been mounted at 10m above ground, especially before
1975. Information in the file AHISTORY.TXT provides a copy of anemometer height
above ground for users interested in adjusting the wind speed to another height
above ground. In general, significant caution is advisable in using wind speeds
before 1975.  Not only were the anemometers installed at heights other than 10m
above ground more frequently before 1975 than after, but the station history
files are often ambiguous as to anemometer height and location. The information
provided in AHISTORY.TXT for some locations is an interpretation of conflicting
or incomplete information in the AES station information files. Other
non-standard anemometer locations, such as on top of aircraft hangers or the
air traffic control tower, also occurred at some locations, mainly before 1975.

Anemometer exposure is also problematic. Most anemometers are located in a
flat, open exposure, especially at major airports. However, some anemometers
are located in more exposed locations, such as Cape St. James, BC, which is on
an exposed headland on the open coast. Observed wind speeds are not
representative of less windy, inland locations, or even other coastal sites not
on an exposed headland. Other locations, such as Fort Simpson, NWT, are
sheltered by trees, and not representative of nearby, more exposed locations.
In general, wind speeds form observing sites are only representative of other
nearby sites if the height above ground and exposures are similar.

Snow cover (field 212) is derived from daily snow depth observations. It is
provided as a guide to estimating the surface albedo (reflectance) for
calculations involving solar irradiance or natural illuminance on
non-horizontal surfaces.  Typical albedo values range from 0.2 for grass or
gravel surfaces to 0.6 for snow surfaces. Freshly fallen snow may have an
albedo value as high as 0.8.


3 How to Access and Use the CWEEDS Files

CD-ROM disk 1 provides CWEEDS files for Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. CD-ROM 2 contains the files
for BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, the Yukon and the Northwest
Territories. The files for each province or territory are located in
subdirectory named accordingly. The files for each location are located in a
subdirectory named with the WBAN number. There is one file for each year for
each location.

The names of the provincial and territorial subdirectories are ONT, QUE, NB,
NS, PEI, NFLD, BC, ALTA, SASK, MAN, YT, and NWT. The format of the names of the
location subdirectories is WxxxxxW, where xxxxx is the WBAN number of the
station. The names of the CWEEDS files themselves are WxxxxxW.Ynn, where xxxxx
is the WBAN number and nn is the last two characters in the year. Thus
BC\W94116W\W94116W.Y89 is the file for Penticton, BC, for 1989.

The files on the CD-ROM have been compressed using WINZIP.


4 Canadian Weather for Energy Calculations (CWEC) Files

The Canadian Weather for Energy Calculations (CWEC) files have been developped
under the auspices of the National Research Council of Canada. They are derived
using statistical criteria from long-term series of CWEEDS files.

The CWEC files are created by concatenating twelve Typical Meteorological
Months selected from a database of, in most cases, 30 years of CWEEDS data. The
method is similar to TMY procedure developed in the eighties by Sandia
Laboratories. The months are chosen by statistically comparing individual
monthly with long-term monthly means for daily total global radiation, mean,
minimum and maximum dry bulb temperature, mean, minimum and maximum dew point
temperature, and mean and maximum wind speed. The composite index used to
select the most 'typical' months uses the following weights (in %)



Parameter   Dry    Dry    Dry     Dew     Dew     Dew    Wind    Wind   Daily
            Bulb   Bulb   Bulb   Point   Point   Point   Speed   Speed  Solar
            Max    Min    Mean    Max     Min    Mean     Max    Mean    Rad.

Weight       5      5      30     2.5     2.5      5       5       5      40



Additional consideration is given, in the selection process, to the statistics
and persistence structures of the daily mean dry bulb temperature and daily
total radiation. A complete description of the procedure used can be found in:
D.L. Siurna, L.J. D'Andrea, K.G.T. Hollands, A Canadian Representative
Meteorological Year for Solar System Simulation, Proceedings of the 10th annual
conference of the Solar Energy Society of Canada (SESCI '84), August 2-6, 1984,
Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

In the CWEC files, no missing values will be found in the following fields:
extraterrestrial irradiance (101), global horizontal irradiance (102), direct
normal irradiance (103), diffuse horizontal irradiance (104), weather (204),
station pressure (205), dry bulb temperature (206), dew point temperature
(207), wind direction (208), wind speed (209), total sky cover (210), opaque
sky cover (211), snow cover (212).

The list of all available CWEC files is given in Appendix D. The years from
which the CWEC typical months were chosen are listed in Appendix E.

APPENDIX A - WYEC2 Format

Weather files in WYEC2 format consist of 8760 identical fixed format records
(8784 records for leap years), one for each hour of each day of the year. Each
record is 116 characters in length and is organized according to the table
below. The flags associated with the data are described in the next section of
the document.

All WYEC2 values are for Local Standard Time. Irradiance and illuminance fields
contain data integrated over the hour, meteorological fields contain
observations made at the end of the hour. For example, hour 12 contains
irradiance/illuminance integrated from 11-12 and meteorological observations
made at 12.

A file containing statistics about the WYEC2 file is assembled (number of
missing records for each element and each year, yearly max and mean values of 
each element). The name of the file is xxxxx.STT, where xxxxx is the WBAN Station
Number.

A file containing statistics about the radiation data is assembled. For this file
the year is divided into four periods centered around March 21 ("spring"), June 21
("summer"), September 21 ("autumn") and December 21 ("winter"). For each trimester
the max and mean of global irradiance, diffuse irradiance and direct irradiance 
are computed for each hour of the day. The file contains a summary with five 
columns: element, trimester, hour, max value and min value. The name of the file is
xxxxx.STR, where xxxxx is the WBAN Station Number. The easiest way to exploit the
the information contained in this file is to retrieve it in a spreadsheet and plot
the various daily profiles.  A visual inspection will then reveal if there is any 
major problem with the radiation data that were modelled.

Important note: CWEC files have always 8760 records. If the selected February
month is from a leap year, it is truncated to 28 days.

Flags

Flag characters indicate if the associated value is missing, was estimated or
modelled or actually observed. Some fields have no flag, others have 1 or 2
character flags as follows:

      Field        Flag type / comment

      001-003      None (record identification fields)

      101          None (calculated extraterrestrial irradiance is always
                   present)

      102-104      2 character (irradiance values)

      105-212      1 character (all remaining fields)


1. One character flags. The following flags are used:

         blank     Value was observed (that is, not derived with a model and
                   not altered).
                   Exception: irradiance and minutes of sunshine flags are
                   written as blank though they are interpolated to change the
                   time base from local apparent to local standard time.

           A       Value has been algorithmically adjusted (e.g. some values in
                   Canadian Reference Years are smoothed at the beginning and
                   end of months).

           E       Value was missing and has been replaced by a hand estimate.

           I       Value was missing and has been replaced with one derived by
                   interpolation from neighboring observations.

           M       Value was missing and has been replaced with one derived
                   with a model (model used depends on element).

           Q       Value is derived from other values (e.g. illuminance data
                   which are not observed).

           9       Value is missing; data positions contain 9s as well.

2. Two character flags for radiation values (on WYEC2 irradiance fields 102,
103 and 104), are a 1 character flag (as defined above) followed by a blank.

 

APPENDIX B - List of locations provided on the AES CWEEDS CD-ROM's.

STATION    is the name of the AES station corresponding to the RAD.CSN.

RAD.CSN    is the Canadian Station Number, an identification number assigned
           and used by AES, of the site where solar radiation is observed (it
           is not always the same site as where the other hourly observations
           are taken).

WX.CSN     is the Canadian Station Number, an identification number assigned
           and used by AES, of the site where the hourly observations other
           that solar irradiance and minutes of sunshine are taken.

LAT        is the latitude (°) of the site corresponding to RAD.CSN.

LONG       is the longitude (°) of the site corresponding to RAD.CSN.

MLONG      is the prime meridian (°) upon which the time zone is based. The
           difference in hours between Local Standard Time (LST) and
           Coordinated Universal Time (CUT) can obtained by the calculation LST
           = CUT - MLONG/15. For instance, if MLONG is 75°, and CUT is 11:00
           then LST is 06:00.

SUN        indicates the source of the minutes of sunshine, if available. W
           indicates that the observations are from the site corresponding to
           WX.CSN. R indicates RAD.CSN. A blank means no observations of
           minutes of bright sunshine are available.

RAD        indicates by an R whether solar irradiance observations are
           available. A blank indicates no observations and all the irradiance
           fields are modelled.

FY         is the last two digits of the first year provided on the CWEEDS
           CD-ROM (i.e. 53 means 1953).

LY         is the last two digits of the last year on the CD-ROM.

(*) Due to the unavailability of many measurements for this station, the Dew
Point Temperature was not taken into account to select typical months. The
weights normally attributed to the Dew Point Temperature in the selection
process were transferred to the Dry Bulb Temperature.
